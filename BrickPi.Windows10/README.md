# Miyop.IoT

Another Raspberry Pi3 and BrickPi3 project with Windows 10 Iot Core. The project demostrates simple video recording feature with some LEGO Mindstorms sensors. Just for this project NXT Touch sensor is used. It is used as start/stop video recording.

The BrickPi3 implementation with C# is a wrapper from Laurent Ellerbach; https://github.com/Ellerbach/BrickPi3
It is a really good port for C#. 

The device is an Azure IoT Hub. So it can receive commands from Azure IoT, but need to create some control process. Hava fun. :)
