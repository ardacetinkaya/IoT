# Some learning & fun projects with Raspberry Pi :computer:

Here you can find some projects to learn simple Raspberry Pi projects and Internet of Things(IoT) concepts. The main concept in this repository to share what I'm learning and having fun.

I am digging with different software technologies such as __Python, .NET Core, C#, Azure, Rasbian__ on Raspberry Pi devices.
